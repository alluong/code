It is worth noting that when you delete nodes in a tree, deletion process will be in post-order. That is to say, when you delete a node,
you will delete its left child and its right child before you delete the node itself.

If you handle this tree in postorder, you can easily handle the expression using a stack. Each time when you meet a operator, you can
just pop 2 elements from the stack, calculate the result and push the result back into the stack.
