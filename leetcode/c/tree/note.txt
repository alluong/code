It is worth noting that when you delete nodes in a tree, deletion process will be in post-order. That is to say, when you delete a node,
you will delete its left child and its right child before you delete the node itself.

If you handle this tree in postorder, you can easily handle the expression using a stack. Each time when you meet a operator, you can
just pop 2 elements from the stack, calculate the result and push the result back into the stack.

Level-order traversal is to traverse the tree level by level.

Breadth-First Search is an algorithm to traverse or search in data structures like a tree or a graph. The algorithm starts with a root
node and visit the node itself first. Then traverse its neighbors, traverse its second level neighbors, traverse its third level
neighbors, so on and so forth.

When we do breadth-first search in a tree, the order of the nodes we visited is in level order.
Typically, we use a queue to help us to do BFS.
